# The AI module taught in English

_NOTE:_ under construction

## Prerequisites

The laboratory aims at a collection of materials for teaching, learning and integrating knowledge from theory to practice. Therefore:

* Have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed on your machine.

Launch your Anaconda Prompt and create a new virtual environment, different from the base one (some [helpful instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) and a [handy cheet sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)).

* Have [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

_Note:_ `python --version` helps you to check the Python version in the command line of your system.

* Have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) ecosystem ready!
  * For an interactive lesson, you should be able to complete the exercises from your local Jupyter Notebook.
  * Clone or download the notebooks for each lab from [ENG_module](https://github.com/AlexandraDobrescu/teachingAI/tree/master/ENG_module) repository.
  * Don't forget to run the `jupyter notebook` command in the **same directory** as your repository.
